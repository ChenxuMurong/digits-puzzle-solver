# Digits-Puzzle-Solver
## A solver for arithmetic puzzles like the New York Times Digits

It goes through all permutations of possible arithmetic operations with the numbers, and lists a specified number of correct solutions. Good for some occasional cheating fun with NYTimes Digits.

All solutions ~~may have parenthesization issues~~ are written in regular mathematic notation with working parentheses and mathematically correct.
