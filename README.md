# Digits-Puzzle-Solver
## A solver for math puzzles like the New York Times Digits

It goes through all permutations of possible arithmetic operations with the numbers, and lists the potential solutions. Good for some occasional cheating fun with NYTimes Digits.

At this stage its solutions are written in ~~Reverse Polish Notation~~ regular mathematic notation with working parentheses and they ~~are mathematically correct~~ may have parenthesization issues.
